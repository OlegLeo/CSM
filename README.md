# Cesae_Stock_Management-Mobile_App



This application was developed during the Web & Mobile Development course together with my two colleagues.

The main objective of this final project of the course was to demonstrate the skills that we acquired along this journey.

This project was a simulation of the work market context, because there was a client that presented us what would be necessary to produce. Meetings were held to better understand the client's needs, project planning, task divisions and a lot of cooperation spirit. 

The application was made in Android Studio, we used Java as programming language and Firebase for the database.

The application allows the user to visualize all the stock that was registered in our training school (Monitors, PC's, Keyboards, Mouses, Tables, Chairs, etc...), insert a new one, remove or edit it, move the equipment from one room to another and also a backoffice user management.

The authentication is done with email and a password, with the possibility of password recovery and user management by the backoffice.

One of the features that we thought to implement was the QR code, being one of the ideas presented in one of the meetings to facilitate stock management. Each piece of equipment is supposed to have a QR code physically glued on it, that when it is read by the mobile device's camera, it opens an info page about the item, from there it is possible to edit the equipment, remove it, or change for example from one table to another.

It was a very interesting project to eleborate with my colleagues and I think it went very well. We got a final grade of 19/20.
